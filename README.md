This project aims to establish a connection between a fournisseur (supplier) and a boutique (shop) using gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) technology in a Node.js environment. The gRPC framework allows efficient and reliable communication between distributed systems, making it an ideal choice for building a robust connection between the fournisseur and boutique.

Project Structure
The project follows a client-server architecture, where the fournisseur acts as the server and the boutique acts as the client. The connection is established using gRPC, which enables the exchange of data and remote procedure calls between the two entities.
